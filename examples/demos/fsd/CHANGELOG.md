# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Movable 360° camera follows the selected vehicle with mouse/touch orbit, wheel/pinch zoom,
  camera buttons, keyboard rotation and recentering. Existing fixed camera views remain available.

- Six selectable vehicle models and paint colours, with distinct proportions, detailed wheels,
  glazing, mirrors, lighting and trim. Driven vehicle dimensions and handling feed physics,
  stopping distances, traffic gaps, collision checks and cameras.
- Tree trunks, signposts, signal poles, lamps, porches and hedges share scenery placement with
  collision geometry; collision feedback identifies the struck object.

- Eight bundled neighbourhoods across seven Canadian cities, including Mount Pleasant, Calgary
  Beltline, Ottawa Centretown and Québec City Saint-Roch. Searchable, filterable world explorer
  with loading states, retries and preserved keyboard focus.
- Mapped buildings block the driven car and candidate predictions with swept footprint checks.
  Route-aware stop memory fixes indefinite waits when the front bumper reaches a stop line
  before the rear axle reaches the controlled segment; off-route driving retains lane auditing.
- Darkness limits forward and peripheral sensing and feeds speed planning. Fixed, real-time
  and accelerated daylight clocks; traffic density, repeatable world seeds and visible pause.
- Bundled Three.js runtime removes CDN startup dependency. A larger local-server request queue
  handles cold asset bursts, and startup failures show an actionable retry instead of an endless spinner.

- Redesigned trip and drive-coach cards, central driving instruments, a live decision summary,
  Settings and keyboard help. Manual drivers now receive turn-by-turn route guidance.
- Scrollable HUD columns and a narrow-screen inspector entry point; keyboard-accessible brain
  buttons, accurate fallback/stop labels, reduced-motion support and opaque instruments.
  HUD text refreshes at most 10 times per second and skips unchanged DOM writes.

- Bundled city selection for Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto and Montréal, with reachable suggested
  drives from the current pose and selected-city routing, benchmarks and replay.
- Live drive scoring for manual and autopilot drives, with category breakdowns, grades, coaching,
  event timelines, JSON export and local history. Waiting and pauses carry no penalty.
- Instanced street-name and speed-limit signs, optional procedural driving audio, indicators,
  a horn, speed warnings, hood-view rain/wipers and optional camera motion.
- Visual interpolation and speed-sensitive keyboard steering. Distance-based scenery detail and
  lighter high-quality GPU budgets; stable ground depth, synchronized shadows and a fix for wet
  reflection texture feedback loops. Measured rendering comparisons are documented separately.

- Building footprints occlude the ego's observations, predictions, and emergency brake. Fog,
  rain, and snow shorten sensing range; signal phases outside sight are unknown. Speed planning
  and candidate filtering use visible stopping room, including blind bends.
- Traffic can reserve a vacant curb bay and park at low speed. Parked cars open animated
  street-side doors with matching collision shapes; traffic reacts to the panels.
- Pull-outs leave more room for approaching traffic. NPC path recovery preserves the moving
  body's position and velocity.
- Jev weighs progress, clearance, comfort, roadside activity, and driving style instead of being
  directed to copy the Rules target-speed preference. Mid-block crossings distinguish approach,
  hold, and clearing the car's path. Candidates report comfort and clearance estimates.
- Eleven committed decision cases are generated through the actual driver pipeline. The snapshot
  checker validates requests offline and checks model expectations when a key is available.
- Live Jev behavior remains unverified; historical benchmark numbers describe the earlier world.

## 0.2.0

A large realism and graphics update. The Rules benchmark (seed 1) still passes 12 of 12 drives in
dry, rain, fog, and snow.

### Graphics
- Time of day with the sun's real path over Vancouver, a dawn and dusk sky, stars, and a moon.
- Ambient occlusion, bloom, and antialiasing, with low, high, and ultra quality settings.
- After dark: street lights with light pools, headlights (real beams on the driven car), tail
  lights, and lit windows. Wet roads mirror the street.
- New trees (leafy crowns that sway and cast dappled shadows), rounder cars with better lights,
  jointed pedestrians and helmeted cyclists, porches, chimneys and hedges, raised curbs, and
  pedestrian signal heads. A hood camera.
- The North Shore mountains, English Bay, downtown, Stanley Park, and the city around the map.

### Simulation
- Signal timing plans from approach speeds (ITE yellow, clearance all-red, walk and flashing hand).
- Drivers with individual temperaments; traffic waits for a gap at two-way stops and backs off from
  nose-to-nose standoffs. Parked cars sometimes pull out.
- Pedestrians sometimes cross mid-block, react to cars that will not stop, and walk at different
  speeds; fewer are out at night.
- Power-limited acceleration, drag, and rolling resistance in the car model.
- The planner anticipates lower speed limits, approaches stops at the target speed, and no longer
  treats a passing oncoming car as the car ahead.

### Fixed
- Traffic could pull out of a two-way stop in front of oncoming cars.
- Two cars could wait for each other indefinitely.
- The chase camera could jump when frames were advanced by hand in headless runs.

### Project
- New Rules baseline run, a new README, and 11 new browser tests.

## 0.1.0

First release: the simulator, the Jev and Rules drivers, the decision panel, and the benchmark.
