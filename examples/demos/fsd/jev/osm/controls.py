"""Traffic signals and stop signs from OSM node tags, attached to graph edges.

OSM marks a signalled intersection with `highway=traffic_signals` on the junction node, or on each
approach node just before it. Both are mapped to the nearest junction vertex and clustered (25 m)
so a dual carriageway becomes one intersection. Every incoming edge from outside the cluster is an
approach with a stop line a few meters before the vertex. Phases are invented in code: OSM has no
timing data. Stop signs (`highway=stop`) apply to the direction the node's `direction` tag says, to
every incoming edge when the node is the junction itself, or otherwise to the direction whose
junction lies ahead of the node. Roundabout entries get a yield line.
